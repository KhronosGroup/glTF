The normal vectors use OpenGL conventions where +X is right and +Y is up. +Z points toward the viewer. In GLSL, this vector would be unpacked like so: `float3 normalVector = tex2D(<sampled normal map texture value>, texCoord) * 2 - 1`. Client implementations should normalize the normal vectors before using them in lighting equations."
