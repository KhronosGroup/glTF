[[introduction-general]]
== General

This document, referred to as the "`glTF 2.0 Asset Object Model Specification`" or just the "`Object Model`" hereafter, describes a portable runtime object model of a glTF asset.

[[motivation]]
== Motivation and Design Goals (Informative)

Although <<gltf,glTF 2.0 Specification>> does not define any runtime behavior, there is a growing demand for manipulating glTF assets at runtime and querying their state in a portable way.

Upon loading, applications usually parse glTF JSON into implementation-specific internal structures and therefore do not have a common protocol to manipulate asset contents.

This document defines a set of <<json-pointer,JSON pointers>> that glTF implementations are expected to support for identifying asset properties that could be manipulated at runtime.

[[basics]]
= Object Model Basics

1. The Object Model is defined only for valid glTF assets. Querying or setting properties of invalid glTF assets are undefined.

2. Upon loading an asset, an implementation registers specific glTF object properties for the Object Model by resolving JSON pointers identified by templates provided by this document to JSON properties of the asset being loaded. Undefined glTF properties that have schema-default values are considered defined with their default values.

3. Each instance of empty curly braces (`{}`) in the pointer templates is replaced with the corresponding array element index for each glTF asset property matching the template.

4. Since JSON does not natively support vectors and matrices, the Object Model defines explicit types for all supported properties. JSON pointers to properties of these types are resolved into implementation-specific vectors and matrices, not raw JSON arrays. Pointers to individual vector or matrix components are not resolved.

5. Pointers to properties of explicit array types (as defined below) are resolved to implementation-defined arrays; pointers to array elements of properties of explicit array types are resolved to the corresponding array elements.

6. In addition to properties directly linked to glTF JSON, the Object Model defines extra read-only properties that reflect commonly-used parts of the glTF runtime state. Specifically, array sizes and current node transforms.

7. If a JSON pointer cannot be resolved to a glTF property, operations with it are undefined.

8. Some pointers are defined as read-only, i.e., applications can access them to discover the asset structure and its runtime state but it is generally not possible to update their values directly. Read-only pointers that represent glTF object references can be made mutable by extensions on a case-by-case basis.

[[types]]
== Data Types

The following data types are assumed by this document:

float::
single or double precision <<ieee-754,IEEE-754>> floating-point type

float[]::
an array of *float* values

float2::
a two-component vector of *float* values read from or set to JSON array elements with indices 0 and 1

float3::
a three-component vector of *float* values read from or set to JSON array elements with indices 0, 1, and 2

float4::
a four-component vector of *float* values read from or set to JSON array elements with indices 0, 1, 2, and 3

float4x4::
a 4x4 matrix of *float* values

bool::
a boolean type

int::
a signed integer type with width of at least 32 bits

All pointers named `*.length` return zero if the corresponding array is not defined.

The `/nodes/{}/matrix` and `/nodes/{}/globalMatrix` pointers represent the node's effective transformation matrices, i.e., the runtime state, regardless of whether the static `matrix` property is used in JSON.

The `/nodes/{}/parent` pointer represents the node's parent, i.e., the index of the node that has the current node listed in its `children` array. If the current node is a root node, this pointer is undefined.
