The glTF 2.0 Specification formerly hosted in this README.md has been moved
to AsciiDoc markup. Published versions of the Specification are now located
in the [glTF Registry](https://www.khronos.org/registry/glTF). The
underlying AsciiDoc markup is in the `main` branch of the [glTF
Specification Repository](https://www.github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF).

A preview of the rendered output of the specification can be seen by
opening the [`Specification.adoc`](Specification.adoc) file, but note that
this preview does not include the properties reference and JSON schema
reference, and will not render embedded mathematical equations correctly.
