To Be Determined License for glTF Vendor Extensions

Copyright 2013-2021 Various Authors

The TBD license is currently used as a placeholder for files that are part
of vendor extensions with currently unknown copyright terms. Until we can
reach clarification, it can be assumed that all such files are copyright by
the vendor responsible for that extension, under terms defined by them but
allowing Khronos to reproduce on our websites and repositories.
