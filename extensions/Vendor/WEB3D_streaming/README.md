## Dependencies

Written against the glTF draft 1.0 spec.

Required extensions:
* KHR_binary_glTF


## Overview

With today's browser technology, basically any buffer can be progressively downloaded, using XHR and streaming APIs.
Therefore, one can argue that Binary glTF can also be used for progressive streaming of mesh data.
However, in practice, this only works for non-indexed meshes.
A buffer of vertex positions, for example, can be progressively retrieved, and partial results can already be displayed.
If the corresponding buffers for vertex normals, for example, should also be progressively retrieved, a second download, performed in parallel, is necessary.
Moreover, to make use of a partial result, the intermediate results of both downloads need to match with each other.
This drawback of having to parallelize (and align) downloads for a progressive retrieval of mesh data also potentially has an impact on application performance, since it is not possible to send all data in a single file (as it can be done with binary_glTF, for example).

This extension introduces the concept of buffer `chunks`. By interleaving content for transmission, buffers can be retrieved progressively, using a limited amount of steps for progression.
By arranging the `chunks` accordingly inside the body of the file, the writer of a Binary glTF file has explicit control over the order in which data is received.
Therefore, it is possible to progressively retrieve parts of indices and corresponding vertex attributes, as shown in Figure 1.

Buffer `chunks` are introduced as a basic layer for addressing binary data, and the standard glTF layer of `bufferViews` must refer to those `chunks` to address binary data within the binary file body.
