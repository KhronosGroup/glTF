## Dependencies

Written against the glTF draft 1.0 spec.

Required extensions:
* EXT_binary_glTF
* EXT_quantized_attributes


## Overview

With glTF, it is possible to transport information about meshes, but also about scene data.
This data may include lighting, scene hierarchy, cameras, as well as other aspects of the scene.
However, it is not clear how a glTF scene could be integrated into an existing scene graph, such as a VRML or X3D scene.

This extension introduces the notion of using glTF as a `Shape Resource Container` (SRC) within an X3D scene.
Concretely speaking, an SRC contains all kinds of resources that are usually specified as part of a `Shape` node in X3D:
* Appearance (usually specified using an `X3DAppearanceNode`)
* Geometry (usually specified using an `X3DGeometryNode`)

In order to externalize this information from the X3D scene graph into a glTF file, this extension provides the following:
* A list of required extensions
* A list of relevant glTF scene content for SRC files
* An addressing scheme that allows to refer to this content from external applications or documents
* Rules that show how to deal with missing ,or ambiguous, glTF scene content when using SRC

This specification also contains recommendations how to integrate the glTF data into the X3D scene, proposing the `ExternalShape`node.
That recommendation is, however, non-normative, and it is only provided for illustrative purposes.
