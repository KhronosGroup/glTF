The data type of property values is determined by the property definition: When `type` is `BOOLEAN` values are packed into a bitfield. When `type` is `STRING` values are stored as byte sequences and decoded as UTF-8 strings. When `type` is a numeric type values are stored as the provided `type`. When `type` is `ENUM` values are stored as the enum's `valueType`. When `type` is `ARRAY` elements are packed tightly together and the data type is based on the `componentType` following the same rules as above. `arrayOffsetBufferView` is required for variable-size arrays and `stringOffsetBufferView` is required for strings (for variable-length arrays of strings, both are required). The buffer view `byteOffset` must be aligned to a multiple of 8 bytes. If the buffer view's `buffer` is the GLB-stored `BIN` chunk, the byte offset is measured relative to the beginning of the GLB. Otherwise, it is measured relative to the beginning of the buffer."
