# EXT_feature_metadata

Assigns metadata to features in a model. Metadata may be assigned on a per-vertex, per-texel, or per-instance basis.

This extension implements the [Cesium 3D Metadata Specification](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles/tree/3d-tiles-next/specification/Metadata/1.0.0).

## Changelog

* [**Version 0.0.0**](0.0.0) December 4, 2020

    * Removed `BLOB` type
    * Added `ENUM` to the list of supported types and component types and added `enumType` to refer to the chosen enum
    * `min` and `max` are now numbers instead of single-element arrays for non-`ARRAY` properties
  * Changes to feature table
    * Removed `offsetBufferViews`, replaced with `arrayOffsetBufferView` and `stringOffsetBufferView`
    * Removed `blobByteLength`
    * Removed `stringByteLength`
    * Removed `name` and `description`
    * Removed `elementCount` and redefined `count` to mean the element count
    * Added optional `semantic` property
  * Changes to feature ID attribute
    * Removed `vertexStride` and `instanceStride`
    * Added `divisor` for incrementing feature IDs at fixed intervals, e.g. per-triangle or per-quad
  * Changes to `EXT_feature_metadata` object
    * Removed `classes` dictionary. Classes and enums are now contained in the `schema` object.
    * Added `schema` and `schemaUri`. The schema object contains class and enum definitions. `schemaUri` refers to an external schema JSON file. `schema` and `schemaUri` are mutually exclusive.

  * Other changes
    * Added `EXT_feature_metadata` extension to the [`EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing) extension for assigning metadata to instances
