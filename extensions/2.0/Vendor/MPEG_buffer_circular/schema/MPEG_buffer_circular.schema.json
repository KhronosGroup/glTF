When tracks array contains multiple tracks, the media pipeline should perform the necessary processing of all referenced tracks to generate the requested data format of the buffer. If the track attribute is present and there are multiple `alternatives` (i.e. indicating equivalent content) in the referenced media, then the selected track shall be present in all alternatives. When more than one track is listed by tracks element, the corresponding buffer is in active state and the application is informed that the corresponding tracks are needed as source for the input buffer, then the application can optimize the delivery of multiple tracks."
