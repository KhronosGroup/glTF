= Overview

Iridescence describes an effect where hue varies depending on the viewing angle and illumination angle: A thin-film of a semi-transparent layer results in inter-reflections and due to thin-film interference, certain wavelengths get absorbed or amplified. Iridescence can be seen on soap bubbles, oil films, or on the wings of many insects.
With this extension, thickness and index of refraction (IOR) of the thin-film can be specified, enabling iridescent materials.

= Extending Materials

The iridescence materials are defined by adding the `KHR_materials_iridescence` extension to any glTF material.

|====

The values for iridescence intensity can be defined using a factor, a texture, or both.
`iridescenceFactor` is multiplied with the red channel of `iridescenceTexture` to control the overall strength of the iridescence effect. If the texture is not set, a value of 1.0 is assumed for the texture.

[source,glsl]
----
iridescence = iridescenceFactor * iridescenceTexture.r
----

If `iridescenceFactor` is zero (default), the iridescence extension has no effect on the material.
All textures in this extension use a single channel in linear space.
The thickness of the thin-film is set to `iridescenceThicknessMaximum` if `iridescenceThicknessTexture` is not given.
If `iridescenceThicknessTexture` is set, the thickness of the thin-film varies between  `iridescenceThicknessMinimum` and `iridescenceThicknessMaximum` as follows:

[source,glsl]
----
thickness = mix(iridescenceThicknessMinimum, iridescenceThicknessMaximum, iridescenceThicknessTexture.g)
----

Aside from light direction and IOR, the thickness of the thin-film defines the variation in hue.
This effect is the result of constructive and destructive interferences of certain wavelengths.
If the the optical path difference between the ray reflected at the thin-film and the ray reflected at the base material is half the wavelength (λ), the resulting 180 degree phase shift is cancelling out the reflected light:

image::figures/interference.png[align="left"]

With a thin-film thickness near half the wavelength of visible light (380 nm - 750 nm), the effect is most visible.
By increasing the thin-film thickness, multiples of wavelengths are still causing wave interferences, however, as the optical path distance increases, different rays are mixed in.
This leads to more pastel colored patterns for increased thickness:

image::figures/thickness-comparison.png[align="left",title="Comparison of different iridescence thickness ranges for a constant iridescence IOR value of 1.3 on a dielectric base material with IOR value of 1.5."]

The thin-film layer can have a different IOR than the underlying material. With `iridescenceIor` one can set an IOR value for the thin-film layer independently. The more this value differs from the IOR of the base material, the stronger the iridescence. It also has an effect on the optical path difference as visible here:

image::figures/ior-comparison.png[align="left",title="Comparison of different iridescence IOR values for a thin-film thickness range between 200 nm (bottom) and 800 nm (top) on a dielectric base material with IOR value of 1.5."]

The iridescence effect is modeled via a microfacet BRDF with a modified Fresnel reflectance term that accounts for inter-reflections as shown in the paper from <<Belcour2017, Belcour/Barla>>.

= Iridescence BRDF

== Metal Base Material

The metal BRDF in the glTF 2.0 core specification in https://www.khronos.org/registry/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#metals[B.2.1 Metals] will be replaced by the following term:

[source]
----
metal_brdf =
  iridescent_conductor_layer(
    iridescence_strength = iridescence,
    iridescence_thickness = iridescenceThickness,
    iridescence_ior = iridescenceIor,
    outside_ior = 1.0,
    base_f0 = baseColor,
    specular_brdf = specular_brdf(
      α = roughness ^ 2))
----

== Dielectric Base Material

The dielectric BRDF in the glTF 2.0 core specification in https://www.khronos.org/registry/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#dielectrics[B.2.2. Dielectrics] will be replaced by the following term:

[source]
----
dielectric_brdf =
  iridescent_dielectric_layer(
    iridescence_strength = iridescence,
    iridescence_thickness = iridescenceThickness,
    iridescence_ior = iridescenceIor,
    outside_ior = 1.0,
    base_ior = 1.5,
    base = diffuse_brdf(
      color = baseColor),
    specular_brdf = specular_brdf(
      α = roughness ^ 2))
----

For transmissive `base` materials, the `diffuse_brdf(...)` will be replaced by the mix between a `diffuse_brdf(...)` and a `specular_btdf(...)` as described in the link:../KHR_materials_transmission#transmission-btdf[`KHR_materials_transmission`] extension.

The `base_ior` can be changed using the link:../KHR_materials_ior[`KHR_materials_ior`] extension.

In case of combining `KHR_materials_iridescence` with link:../KHR_materials_specular/README.md[`KHR_materials_specular`], `dielectric_brdf` becomes the following:

[source]
----
dielectric_brdf =
  iridescent_dielectric_layer(
    iridescence_strength = iridescence,
    iridescence_thickness = iridescenceThickness,
    iridescence_ior = iridescenceIor,
    outside_ior = 1.0,
    base_ior = 1.5,
    base_f0_color = specularColor.rgb,
    specular_weight = specular,
    base = diffuse_brdf(
      color = baseColor),
    specular_brdf = specular_brdf(
      α = roughness ^ 2))
----

== Clearcoat

When adding a clearcoat ontop, an additional interface between the clearcoat and thin-film layer would be created. Due to simplicity and artistical friendlyness, this interface is ignored.

[[implementation]]
= Implementation Notes

== Metal Base Material

[source]
----
function iridescent_conductor_layer(iridescence_strength, iridescence_thickness, iridescence_ior, outside_ior, base_f0, specular_brdf) {
  return mix(
    conductor_fresnel(base_f0, specular_brdf),
    specular_brdf * iridescent_fresnel(
      outside_ior,
      iridescence_ior,
      base_f0,
      iridescence_thickness),
    iridescence_strength)
}
----

== Dielectric Base Material

[source]
----
function iridescent_dielectric_layer(iridescence_strength, iridescence_thickness, iridescence_ior, outside_ior, base_ior, base, specular_brdf) {
  base_f0 = ((1-base_ior)/(1+base_ior))^2

  iridescent_f = iridescent_fresnel(
    outside_ior,
    iridescence_ior,
    base_f0,
    iridescence_thickness)

  return mix(
    fresnel_mix(base_ior, base, specular_brdf),
    rgb_mix(base, specular_brdf, iridescent_f),
    iridescence_strength)
}
----

Similar to link:../KHR_materials_specular/README.md#implementation[`KHR_materials_specular`], to ensure energy conservation, the base BRDF is weighted with the inverse of the maximum component value of the iridescence Fresnel color and then added with the specular iridescence BRDF inside the `rgb_mix()` function:

[source]
----
function rgb_mix(base, specular_brdf, rgb_alpha) {
    rgb_alpha_max = max(rgb_alpha.r, rgb_alpha.g, rgb_alpha.b)

    return (1 - rgb_alpha_max) * base + rgb_alpha * specular_brdf
}
----

If instead `1 - rgb_alpha` would be used directly, inverse colors would be created. By using the maximum component value, no energy would be gained.

When using this extension together with the link:../KHR_materials_specular/README.md#implementation[`KHR_materials_specular`] extension the `iridescent_dielectric_layer()` function changes slightly (as already pointed out in the previous section):

[source]
----
function iridescent_dielectric_layer(iridescence_strength, iridescence_thickness, iridescence_ior, outside_ior, base_ior, base_f0_color, specular_weight, base, specular_brdf) {
  base_f0 = ((1-base_ior)/(1+base_ior))^2 * base_f0_color
  base_f0 = min(base_f0, float3(1.0))
  fr = base_f0 + (1 - base_f0)*(1 - abs(VdotH))^5

  iridescent_f = iridescent_fresnel(
    outside_ior,
    iridescence_ior,
    specular_weight * base_f0,
    iridescence_thickness)

  return rgb_mix(
    base,
    specular_brdf,
    mix(specular_weight * fr, iridescent_f, iridescence_strength))
}
----

The two additional parameters `base_f0_color` and `specular_weight` correspond to `f0_color` and `weight` of the `dielectric_brdf` in link:../KHR_materials_specular/README.md#extending-materials[`KHR_materials_specular`].

== Iridescence Fresnel

_This section is non-normative._

The calculation of `iridescent_fresnel(...)` is described in the following sections as GLSL code at the viewing angle latexmath:[\theta_1]. For glTF an approximation of the original model (defined in the Mitsuba code example from <<Belcour2017, Belcour/Barla>>) is used.

[source,glsl]
----
vec3 iridescent_fresnel(outsideIor, iridescenceIor, baseF0, iridescenceThickness, cosTheta1) {
    vec3 F_iridescence = vec3(0.0);

    // Calculation of the iridescence Fresnel for the viewing angle theta1
    ...

    return F_iridescence;
}
----

=== *Material Interfaces*

The iridescence model defined by <<Belcour2017, Belcour/Barla>> models two material interfaces - one from the outside to the thin-film layer and another one from the thin-film to the base material. These two interfaces are defined as follows:

[source,glsl]
----
// First interface
float R0 = IorToFresnel0(iridescenceIor, outsideIor);
float R12 = F_Schlick(R0, cosTheta1);
float R21 = R12;
float T121 = 1.0 - R12;

// Second interface
vec3 baseIor = Fresnel0ToIor(baseF0 + 0.0001); // guard against 1.0
vec3 R1 = IorToFresnel0(baseIor, iridescenceIor);
vec3 R23 = F_Schlick(R1, cosTheta2);
----

`iridescenceIor` is the index of refraction of the thin-film layer, `outsideIor` the IOR outside the thin-film (usually air) and `baseIor` the IOR of the base material. The latter is calculated from its F0 value using the inverse of the special normal incidence case of Fresnel's equations:

[source,glsl]
----
// Assume air interface for top
vec3 Fresnel0ToIor(vec3 F0) {
    vec3 sqrtF0 = sqrt(F0);
    return (vec3(1.0) + sqrtF0) / (vec3(1.0) - sqrtF0);
}
----

This simple formula is used for both dielectrics and metals. While it is physically correct for dielectric materials, it's only an approximation for metals, which are usually described using a complex IOR with an additional extinction factor. Such a value cannot be accurately inferred from the F0 value and is thus assumed to be `0.0`.

To calculate the reflectance factors at normal incidence of both interfaces (`R0` and `R1`), the special case is used as is:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large\color{gray}\displaystyle

latexmath:[R = \left| \frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2 } \right|^2]

[source,glsl]
----
float IorToFresnel0(float transmittedIor, float incidentIor) {
    return pow((transmittedIor - incidentIor) / (transmittedIor + incidentIor), 2.0);
}
----

To calculate the reflectances `R12` and `R23` at the viewing angles
latexmath:[\theta_1] (angle hitting the thin-film layer) and
latexmath:[\theta_2] (angle after refraction in the thin-film) Schlick
Fresnel is again used. This approximation allows to eliminate the split into
S and P polarization for the exact Fresnel equations.

latexmath:[\theta_2] can be calculated using Snell's law (with
latexmath:[\eta_1] being `outsideIor` and latexmath:[\eta_2] being
`iridescenceIor`):

latexmath:[\cos(\theta_2) = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\eta_1}{\eta_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(1-\cos^2(\theta_1)\right)}]

[source,glsl]
----
float sinTheta2Sq = pow(outsideIor / iridescenceIor, 2.0) * (1.0 - pow(cosTheta1, 2.0));
float cosTheta2Sq = 1.0 - sinTheta2Sq;

// Handle total internal reflection
if (cosTheta2Sq < 0.0) {
    return vec3(1.0);
}

float cosTheta2 = sqrt(cosTheta2Sq);
----

=== *Phase Shift*

The phase shift is as follows:

latexmath:[\Delta \phi = 2 \pi \lambda^{-1} \mathcal{D}]

and depends on the first-order optical path difference latexmath:[\mathcal{D}] (or `OPD`):

[source,glsl]
----
OPD = 2.0 * iridescenceIor * iridescenceThickness * cosTheta1;
----

`phi12` and `phi23` define the base phases per interface and are approximated with `0.0` if the IOR of the hit material (`iridescenceIor` or `baseIor`) is higher than the IOR of the previous material (`outsideIor` or `iridescenceIor`) and latexmath:[\pi] otherwise. Also here, polarization is ignored.

[source,glsl]
----
// First interface
float phi12 = 0.0;
if (iridescenceIor < outsideIor) phi12 = M_PI;
float phi21 = M_PI - phi12;

// Second interface
vec3 phi23 = vec3(0.0);
if (baseIor[0] < iridescenceIor) phi23[0] = M_PI;
if (baseIor[1] < iridescenceIor) phi23[1] = M_PI;
if (baseIor[2] < iridescenceIor) phi23[2] = M_PI;

// Phase shift
vec3 phi = vec3(phi21) + phi23;
----

=== *Analytic Spectral Integration*

Spectral integration is performed in the Fourier space.

[source,glsl]
----
// Compound terms
vec3 R123 = clamp(R12 * R23, 1e-5, 0.9999);
vec3 r123 = sqrt(R123);
vec3 Rs = sq(T121) * R23 / (vec3(1.0) - R123);

// Reflectance term for m = 0 (DC term amplitude)
vec3 C0 = R12 + Rs;
I = C0;

// Reflectance term for m > 0 (pairs of diracs)
vec3 Cm = Rs - T121;
for (int m = 1; m <= 2; ++m)
{
    Cm *= r123;
    vec3 Sm = 2.0 * evalSensitivity(float(m) * OPD, float(m) * phi);
    I += Cm * Sm;
}

F_iridescence = max(I, vec3(0.0));
----

With the sensitivity evaluation function being:

[source,glsl]
----
vec3 evalSensitivity(float OPD, vec3 shift) {
    float phase = 2.0 * M_PI * OPD * 1.0e-9;
    vec3 val = vec3(5.4856e-13, 4.4201e-13, 5.2481e-13);
    vec3 pos = vec3(1.6810e+06, 1.7953e+06, 2.2084e+06);
    vec3 var = vec3(4.3278e+09, 9.3046e+09, 6.6121e+09);

    vec3 xyz = val * sqrt(2.0 * M_PI * var) * cos(pos * phase + shift) * exp(-sq(phase) * var);
    xyz.x += 9.7470e-14 * sqrt(2.0 * M_PI * 4.5282e+09) * cos(2.2399e+06 * phase + shift[0]) * exp(-4.5282e+09 * sq(phase));
    xyz /= 1.0685e-7;

    vec3 rgb = XYZ_TO_REC709 * xyz;
    return rgb;
}
----

and the color space transformation matrix to convert from XYZ to RGB:

[source,glsl]
----
const mat3 XYZ_TO_REC709 = mat3(
     3.2404542, -0.9692660,  0.0556434,
    -1.5371385,  1.8760108, -0.2040259,
    -0.4985314,  0.0415560,  1.0572252
);
----

The full derivation of the fast analytical spectral integration is described in the original publication in section 4 (Analytical Spectral Integration) and will not be described in detail here.
