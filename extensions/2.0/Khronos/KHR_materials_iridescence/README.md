## Status

Draft

## Dependencies

Written against the glTF 2.0 spec.

## Exclusions

* This extension must not be used on a material that also uses `KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness`.
* This extension must not be used on a material that also uses `KHR_materials_unlit`.

## Overview

Iridescence describes an effect where hue varies depending on the viewing angle and illumination angle: A thin-film of a semi-transparent layer results in inter-reflections and due to thin-film interference, certain wavelengths get absorbed or amplified. Iridescence can be seen on soap bubbles, oil films, or on the wings of many insects.
With this extension, thickness and index of refraction (IOR) of the thin-film can be specified, enabling iridescent materials. 

## Extending Materials

The iridescence materials are defined by adding the `KHR_materials_iridescence` extension to any glTF material.

### Iridescence

All implementations should use the same calculations for the BRDF inputs. Implementations of the BRDF itself can vary based on device performance and resource constraints. See [appendix](https://www.khronos.org/registry/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#appendix-b-brdf-implementation) for more details on the BRDF calculations.

The values for iridescence intensity can be defined using a factor, a texture, or both.
`iridescenceFactor` is multiplied with the red channel of `iridescenceTexture` to control the overall strength of the iridescence effect. If the texture is not set, a value of 1.0 is assumed for the texture. 
```
iridescence = iridescenceFactor * iridescenceTexture.r
```

If `iridescenceFactor` is zero (default), the iridescence extension has no effect on the material. 
All textures in this extension use a single channel in linear space. 
The thickness of the thin-film is set to `iridescenceThicknessMaximum` if `iridescenceThicknessTexture` is not given.
If `iridescenceThicknessTexture` is set, the thickness of the thin-film varies between  `iridescenceThicknessMinimum` and `iridescenceThicknessMaximum` as follows: 
```
thickness = mix(iridescenceThicknessMinimum, iridescenceThicknessMaximum, iridescenceThicknessTexture.g)
```

Aside from light direction and IOR, the thickness of the thin-film defines the variation in hue. 
This effect is the result of constructive and destructive interferences of certain wavelengths. 
If the the optical path difference between the ray reflected at the thin-film and the ray reflected at the base material is half the wavelength (Î»), the resulting 180 degree phase shift is cancelling out the reflected light:

<figcaption><em> </em></figcaption>
</figure>

With a thin-film thickness near half the wavelength of visible light (380 nm - 750 nm), the effect is most visible. 
By increasing the thin-film thickness, multiples of wavelengths are still causing wave interferences, however, as the optical path distance increases, different rays are mixed in. 
This leads to more pastel colored patterns for increased thickness:

</figure>

The thin-film layer can have a different IOR than the underlying material. With `iridescenceIOR` one can set an IOR value for the thin-film layer independently. 
This also has an effect on the optical path difference:

<img src="./figures/ior-comparison.jpg"/>
<figcaption><em>Comparison of different iridescence IOR values for a thin-film thickness range between 200 nm (bottom) and 800 nm (top).</em></figcaption>
</figure>


The iridescence effect is modeled via a microfacet BRDF with a modified Fresnel reflectance term that accounts for inter-reflections as shown in [Laurent Belcour and Pascal Barla (2017)](https://belcour.github.io/blog/research/publication/2017/05/01/brdf-thin-film.html).


## Implementation Notes

*This section is non-normative.*

For the calculation of `f_specular`, the original Fresnel term `F_schlick` is exchanged with a newly introduced `F_iridescence` term. 
To artistically control the strength of the iridescence effect, the two Fresnel terms are mixed by using the `iridescenceFactor`:
```
F = mix(F_schlick, F_iridescence, iridescenceFactor)
```

To calculate `F_iridescence` we need to calculate the spectral differences. 
At first, optical path differences (`diff`) between rays reflected at the thin-film and at the base material have to be calculated:
```
diff = 2.0 * IOR_iridescence * thin_film_thickness * cos(viewAngle)
```
With the path difference, the phase shift can be calculated in Fourier space.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle%20\Delta%20\phi%20=%202%20\pi%20\lambda^{-1}\text{diff}">

A complete implementation for evaluating `F_iridescence` can be found in the shader file of the Khronos Sample Viewer:
[iridescence.glsl](https://github.com/PascalSchoen/glTF-Sample-Viewer/blob/feature/KHR_materials_iridescence/source/Renderer/shaders/iridescence.glsl)

### Clearcoat
Considering KHR_materials_clearcoat extension, the clearcoat layer is evaluated before the thin-film layer. 
Light that is passing through the clearcoat is then processed as described taking into account differences in IOR.
