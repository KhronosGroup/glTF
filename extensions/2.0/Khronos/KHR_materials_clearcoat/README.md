## Status

Complete

## Dependencies

Written against the glTF 2.0 spec.

## Exclusions

* This extension must not be used on a material that also uses `KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness`.
* This extension must not be used on a material that also uses `KHR_materials_unlit`.

## Overview

This extension defines a clear coating that can be layered on top of an existing glTF material definition.  A clear coat is a common technique used in Physically-Based Rendering to represent a protective layer applied to a base material.  See [Theory, Documentation and Implementations](#theory-documentation-and-implementations)

## Extending Materials

The PBR clearcoat materials are defined by adding the `KHR_materials_clearcoat` extension to any compatible glTF material (excluding those listed above).  For example, the following defines a material like varnish using clearcoat parameters.

```json
{
    "materials": [
        {
            "name": "varnish",
            "extensions": {
                "KHR_materials_clearcoat": {
                    "clearcoatFactor": 1.0
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Clearcoat

The following parameters are contributed by the `KHR_materials_clearcoat` extension:
|                                  | Type                                                                            | Description                            | Required             |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|
|**clearcoatFactor**               | `number`                                                                        | The clearcoat layer intensity.         | No, default: `0.0`   |
|**clearcoatTexture**              | [`textureInfo`](/specification/2.0/README.md#reference-textureInfo)             | The clearcoat layer intensity texture. | No                   |
|**clearcoatRoughnessFactor**      | `number`                                                                        | The clearcoat layer roughness.         | No, default: `0.0`   |
|**clearcoatRoughnessTexture**     | [`textureInfo`](/specification/2.0/README.md#reference-textureInfo)             | The clearcoat layer roughness texture. | No                   |
|**clearcoatNormalTexture**        | [`normalTextureInfo`](/specification/2.0/README.md#reference-normaltextureinfo) | The clearcoat normal map texture.      | No                   |

If `clearcoatFactor` (in the extension) is zero, the whole clearcoat layer is disabled.

The values for clearcoat layer intensity and clearcoat roughness can be defined using factors, textures, or both. If the `clearcoatTexture` or `clearcoatRoughnessTexture` is not given, respective texture components are assumed to have a value of 1.0. All clearcoat textures contain RGB components in linear space. If both factors and textures are present, the factor value acts as a linear multiplier for the corresponding texture values.

```
clearcoat = clearcoatFactor * clearcoatTexture.r
clearcoatRoughness = clearcoatRoughnessFactor * clearcoatRoughnessTexture.g
```

If `clearcoatNormalTexture` is not given, no normal mapping is applied to the clear coat layer, even if normal mapping is applied to the base material.  Otherwise, `clearcoatNormalTexture` may be a reference to the same normal map used by the base material, or any other compatible normal map.

The clearcoat effect is modeled via a microfacet BRDF. The BRDF is layered on top of the glTF 2.0 Metallic-Roughness material, including emission and all extensions, using a new `fresnel_coat` function:

```
# from glTF 2.0 Metallic-Roughness material (core)
material = mix(dielectric_brdf, metal_brdf, metallic)

# clearcoat
clearcoat_brdf = specular_brdf(
  normal = clearcoatNormal,
  α = clearcoatRoughness^2)

# layering
coated_material =
  fresnel_coat(
    normal = clearcoatNormal,
    ior = 1.5,
    weight = clearcoat,
    base = material,
    layer = clearcoat_brdf)
```

The `fresnel_coat` function adds a BRDF as a layer on top of another BSDF according to `weight` and a Fresnel term. The layer is weighted with `weight*fresnel(ior)`. The base is weighted with `1-(weight*fresnel(ior))`. `normal` is a float3 vector that affects the top layer, but not the base.

### Implementation

*This section is non-normative.*

Implementations of the BRDF or the layering operator can vary based on device performance and resource constraints.

#### Clearcoat BRDF

The specular BRDF for the clearcoat layer `clearcoat_brdf` is computed using the specular term from the glTF 2.0 Metallic-Roughness material, defined in [Appendix B](/specification/2.0/README.md#appendix-b-brdf-implementation). Roughness and normal are taken from `clearcoatNormal` and `clearcoatRoughness`.

#### Layering

The `fresnel_coat` function is computed using the Schlick Fresnel term from the glTF 2.0 Metallic-Roughness material, defined in [Appendix B](/specification/2.0/README.md#appendix-b-brdf-implementation).

```
function fresnel_coat(normal, ior, weight, base, layer) {
  f0 = ((1-ior)/(1+ior))^2
  fr = f0 + (1 - f0)*(1 - abs(NdotV))^5   // N = normal
  return mix(base, layer, weight * fr)
}
```

Applying the functions we arrive at the coated material

```
coated_material = mix(material, clearcoat_brdf(clearcoatRughness^2), clearcoat * (0.04 + (1 - 0.04) * (1 - NdotV)^5))
```

and finally, substituting and simplifying, using some symbols from [Appendix B](/specification/2.0/README.md#appendix-b-brdf-implementation) and `Nc` for the clearcoat normal:

```
clearcoatFresnel = 0.04 + (1 - 0.04) * (1 - abs(VdotNc))^5
clearcoatAlpha = clearcoatRoughness^2

f_clearcoat = clearcoatFresnel * D(clearcoatAlpha) * G / (4 * abs(VdotNc) * abs(LdotNc))

coated_material = (f_diffuse + f_specular) * (1 - clearcoat * clearcoatFresnel) +
                  f_clearcoat * clearcoat
```

#### Emission

The clearcoat layer is on top of emission in the layering stack. Consequently, the emission is darkened by the Fresnel term.

```
coated_emission = emission * (0.04 + (1 - 0.04) * (1 - NdotV)^5)
```

#### Discussion

In order to make the material energy conserving with a simple layering function, we compute the microfacet Fresnel term with `NdotV` instead of `VdotH`. That means that we ignore the orientation of the microsurface. As the clearcoat roughness is usually very low the microfacets orientation is very close to the normal direction, and `NdotV ≈ NdotL`.

The simple layering function ignores many effects that occur between clearcoat and base layer. For example:
* The clearcoat layer is assumed to be infinitely thin. There is no refraction.
* The index of refraction of clearcoat and base layer do not influence each other. The Fresnel terms are computed independently.
* There is no scattering between layers.
* There is no diffraction.

More sophisticated layering techniques that improve the accuracy of the renderings are described in [Appendix B](/specification/2.0/README.md#appendix-b-brdf-implementation).
