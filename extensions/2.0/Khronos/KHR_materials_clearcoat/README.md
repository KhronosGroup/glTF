## Status

Draft

## Dependencies

Written against the glTF 2.0 spec.

## Exclusions

* This extension must not be used on a material that also uses `KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness`.
* This extension must not be used on a material that also uses `KHR_materials_unlit`.

## Overview

This extension defines a clear coating that can be layered on top of an existing glTF material definition.  A clear coat is a common technique used in Physically-Based Rendering to represent a protective layer applied to a base material.  See [Theory, Documentation and Implementations](#theory-documentation-and-implementations)

## Extending Materials

The PBR clearcoat materials are defined by adding the `KHR_materials_clearcoat` extension to any compatible glTF material (excluding those listed above).  For example, the following defines a material like varnish using clearcoat parameters.

```json
{
    "materials": [
        {
            "name": "varnish",
            "extensions": {
                "KHR_materials_clearcoat": {
                    "clearcoatFactor": 1.0
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Clearcoat

All implementations should use the same calculations for the BRDF inputs. Implementations of the BRDF itself can vary based on device performance and resource constraints. See [Appendix B](/specification/2.0/README.md#appendix-b-brdf-implementation) for more details on the BRDF calculations.

|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|
|**clearcoatFactor**               | `number`                                                                        | The clearcoat layer intensity.         | No, default: `0.0`   |
|**clearcoatTexture**              | [`textureInfo`](/specification/2.0/README.md#reference-textureInfo)             | The clearcoat layer intensity texture. | No                   |
|**clearcoatRoughnessFactor**      | `number`                                                                        | The clearcoat layer roughness.         | No, default: `0.0`   |
|**clearcoatRoughnessTexture**     | [`textureInfo`](/specification/2.0/README.md#reference-textureInfo)             | The clearcoat layer roughness texture. | No                   |
|**clearcoatNormalTexture**        | [`normalTextureInfo`](/specification/2.0/README.md#reference-normaltextureinfo) | The clearcoat normal map texture.      | No                   |
  
The clearcoat formula `f_clearcoat` is computed using the specular term from the glTF 2.0 Metallic-Roughness material, defined in [Appendix B](/specification/2.0/README.md#appendix-b-brdf-implementation).  Use specular F0 equal `0.04`, base color black `0.0, 0.0, 0.0`, metallic value `0.0`, and the clearcoat roughness value defined in this extension as follows:

```
clearcoatRoughness = clearcoatRoughnessFactor * clearcoatRoughnessTexture.g
```

The following abstract code describes how the base and clearcoat layers should be blended together:
  
```
clearcoatBlendFactor = clearcoatTexture.r * clearcoatFactor
clearcoatFresnel = fresnel(0.04, NdotV)

color = (f_emissive + f_diffuse + f_specular) * (1.0 - clearcoatBlendFactor * clearcoatFresnel) +
        f_clearcoat * clearcoatBlendFactor
```

If `clearcoatFactor` (in the extension) is zero, the whole clearcoat layer is disabled.

The values for clearcoat layer intensity and clearcoat roughness can be defined using factors, textures, or both. If the `clearcoatTexture` or `clearcoatRoughnessTexture` is not given, respective texture components are assumed to have a value of 1.0. All clearcoat textures contain RGB components in linear space. If both factors and textures are present, the factor value acts as a linear multiplier for the corresponding texture values.

If `clearcoatNormalTexture` is not given, no normal mapping is applied to the clear coat layer, even if normal mapping is applied to the base material.  Otherwise, `clearcoatNormalTexture` may be a reference to the same normal map used by the base material, or any other compatible normal map.
