## Status

Draft

## Dependencies

Written against the glTF 2.0 spec.

* This extension depends on [`KHR_materials_transmission`](https://github.com/MiiBond/glTF/tree/KHR_materials_transmission_v1/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_transmission).
* This extension depends on [`KHR_materials_ior`](https://github.com/DassaultSystemes-Technology/glTF/tree/KHR_materials_ior/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_ior).

## Exclusions

## Overview

This extension combines transmission and index of refraction properties to achieve refractive, transmissive materials.
