## Status

### TODO - Iterate on this to address some of the concerns around this current implementation, as well as incorporate it into the refactored extension hierarchy with KHR_character_expression

**Draft** â€“ This extension is not yet ratified by the Khronos Group and is subject to change.

## Dependencies

Written against the glTF 2.0 specification.  
Requires the extension(s): `KHR_character`,`KHR_character_expression`
Works alongside: `KHR_character_expression_mapping`, `KHR_character_expression_joint`, `KHR_character_expression_texture`, `KHR_character_expression_morphtargets`.

## Overview

The `KHR_character_expression_procedural` extension introduces a metadata layer that defines which expressions are expected to be procedurally generated or controlled at runtime. This includes expressions such as:

- **Timed blinking**
- **Eye darting**
- **Idle mouth movement**
- **Microexpressions**
- **Randomized twitches or gestures**

Expressions in this context describe face-localized animations used to drive small and/or larger movements across the face and/or down-chain meshes needed for reasonable conveyance of emotion/intent.

By labeling expressions as procedural, this extension enables runtime systems (e.g., animation controllers, live-tracking systems, or AI characters) to drive those expressions without conflict with animation data or user inputs.

This metadata is **descriptive only**: it does not contain animation or behavior logic itself. Instead, it signals to tools and engines that the following expressions are _expected to be dynamically generated_.

## Use Cases

- Define which expressions are not statically animated but generated procedurally
- Avoid conflict between procedural and baked expression systems
- Inform rig exporters or runtime systems which expressions are reserved for real-time generation

### Properties

| Property             | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `conflictResolution` | string | Conflict Resolution route used to determine the resolution strategy when multiple sources (procedural and non-procedural) want to control a given expression |

## Expression Control Behavior

To help define how procedural expressions interact with animation systems, this extension introduces an additional field called `conflictResolution`, inspired by the [VRM 1.0 specification](https://github.com/vrm-c/vrm-specification/blob/master/specification/VRMC_vrm-1.0/expressions.md#lip-sync-procedural).

Each procedural expression may declare a resolution strategy for combining procedural output with baked animation data.

### `conflictResolution` Enum

| Value   | Meaning                                                                                  |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`  | No procedural influence. The expression is controlled exclusively by animation or input. |
| `block` | Procedural output _overrides_ animation data while active.                               |
| `blend` | Procedural and animation data may be blended or accumulated together.                    |


This allows developers to distinguish expressions meant to supplement animation (e.g., micro-blinks over emotive acting) versus those that must fully override input (e.g., forced gaze).

## Implementation Notes

- This extension is schema-only and does not contain behavior logic or animation data.
- Runtimes may use this to suppress baked animation for procedural targets.
