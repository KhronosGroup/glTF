## Status

Complete

### Important Notice

_While this extension is marked as complete, it is under review [pending a potential new version](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/pull/1893) to align it closer with the [JSON-LD serialization of XMP data ISO specification](https://www.iso.org/standard/79384.html). We recommend waiting to implement KHR_xmp until development the new version is complete._

## Dependencies

Written against the glTF 2.0 spec.

## Overview

This extension adds support for [XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform) (ISO 16684-1)](https://www.iso.org/standard/75163.html) metadata to glTF.
Metadata is used to transmit information (such as attribution, licensing, creation date) about the glTF asset. Metadata has no normative effect on the glTF asset appearence and rendering.
XMP is a technology for embedding metadata into documents and has been [an ISO standard since 2012](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/news/magazine/ISO%20Focus+%20(2010-2013)/en/2012/ISO%20Focus+,%20May%202012.pdf).
An instance of the XMP data model is called an XMP packet (ISO 16684-1$6.1).
XMP metadata is embedded in a top-level glTF extension as an array of metadata packets.
XMP metadata packets can then be referenced from glTF objects of type: `asset`, `scene`, `node`, `mesh`, `material`, `image`, `animation`.
XMP metadata referenced by the glTF top level object `asset` applies to the entire glTF asset.
XMP metadata is organized in namespaces (ISO 16684-1$6.2). This extension enables any XMP metadata namespace to be embedded in a glTF asset.

## XMP data types

This section describes how [XMP data types (ISO 16684-1$6.3)](https://github.com/adobe/xmp-docs/tree/master/XMPNamespaces/XMPDataTypes) shall be encoded in a glTF JSON.
XMP supports three classes of data types: simple, structure and array. XMP structures are encoded via JSON objects. XMP arrays are encoded via JSON arrays.
XMP simple values are generally encoded via JSON strings with the exception of `Boolean`, `Integer` and `Real` that are encoded as described below.

### XMP Core Properties

The following table describes how [XMP Core Properties (ISO 16684-1$8.2)](https://github.com/adobe/xmp-docs/blob/master/XMPNamespaces/XMPDataTypes/CoreProperties.md) are encoded in the glTF manifest.

## Defining XMP Metadata

An indirection level is introduced to avoid replicating the same XMP metadata in multiple glTF objects.
XMP metadatas are defined within a dictionary property in the glTF scene description file by adding an `extensions` property to the top-level glTF 2.0 object and defining a `KHR_xmp` object. The `KHR_xmp` object defines two properties:

* `@context` : a dictionary mapping XMP namespaces to the URI where they are defined.
Please note that the context definition conforms with [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/2018/jsonld-cg-reports/json-ld/#the-context).
* `packets`: an array of metadata packets referencing the namespaces defined in the `@context` dictionary.

The following example defines a glTF scene with a sample XMP metadata.

```json
"extensions": {
    "KHR_xmp" : {
        "@context" : {
            "dc" : "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
        },
        "packets" : [
            {
                "dc:contributor" : [ "Creator1Name", "Creator2Email@email.com", "Creator3Name<Email@email.com>"],
                "dc:coverage" : "Bay Area, California, United States",
                "dc:creator" : [ "CreatorName", "CreatorEmail@email.com"],
                "dc:date" : ["1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00"],
                "dc:description" : { "en-us": "text"},
                "dc:format" : "model/gltf-binary",
                "dc:identifier" : "urn:stock-id:292930",
                "dc:language" : ["en"],
                "dc:publisher" : ["Company"],
                "dc:relation" : ["https://www.khronos.org/"],
                "dc:rights" : {"en-us": "BSD"},
                "dc:source" : "http://related_resource.org/derived_from_this.gltf",
                "dc:subject" : ["architecture"],
                "dc:title" : { "en-us" : "MyModel", "it-it" : "Mio Modello"},
                "dc:type" : ["Physical Object"],
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Instantiating XMP metadata

Metadata can be instantiated in a gltf object by defining the `extensions.KHR_xmp` property and, within that, an index into the `packets` array using the `packet` property.
The following example shows a glTF Mesh instantiating the XMP metadata at index `0`.

```json
{
    "meshes": [
      {
        "extensions" : {
            "KHR_xmp": {
                "packet" : 0,
            }
        },
        "primitives": [
          {
            "attributes": {
                "NORMAL": 23,
                "POSITION": 22,
                "TANGENT": 24,
                "TEXCOORD_0": 25
            },
            "indices": 21,
            "material": 3,
            "mode": 4
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
}
```

### Notes:

#### Precedence

Metadata applied to JSON objects in the top level arrays ( `scenes`, `nodes`, `meshes`, `materials`, `images`, `animations`) has precedence over the metadata specified in the `asset` property of a glTF.
A glTF might reference resources already containing XMP metadata. A relevant example would be an image object referencing a PNG/JPG file with embedded XMP metadata. Note that glTF clients and viewers may ignore the metadata embedded in the referenced resources (for instance PNG/JPG images).

#### Transferring and merging metadata

When a glTF object (for example a Mesh) is copied from a glTF file to another, the associated `KHR_xmp` metadata should be copied as well.
Copying metadata requires adding the source object's metadata packets to the destination glTF's `KHR_xmp.packets` array.
In the following example two glTFs containing a mesh with `KHR_xmp` metadata are copied into a third glTF.

glTF containing the first mesh:

```json
{
    "meshes": [
      {
        "extensions" : { "KHR_xmp": { "packet" : 0 } },
        ...
      }
    ],
    "extensions": {
        "KHR_xmp" : {
            "@context" : { "dc" : "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" },
            "packets" : [{
                "dc:title" : { "en-us" : "My first mesh"},
                ...
            }]
        }
    }
}
```

glTF containing the second mesh:

```json
{
    "meshes": [
      {
        "extensions" : { "KHR_xmp": { "packet" : 0 } },
        ...
      }
    ],
    "extensions": {
        "KHR_xmp" : {
            "@context" : { "dc" : "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" },
            "packets" : [{
                "dc:title" : { "en-us" : "My second mesh"},
                ...
            }]
        }
    }
}
```

glTF containing copies of both meshes:

```json
{
    "meshes": [
      {
        "extensions" : { "KHR_xmp": { "packet" : 0 } },
        ...
      },
      {
        "extensions" : { "KHR_xmp": { "packet" : 1 } },
        ...
      }
    ],
    "extensions": {
        "KHR_xmp" : {
            "@context" : { "dc" : "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" },
            "packets" : [
              {
                "dc:title" : { "en-us" : "My first mesh"},
                ...
              },
              {
                "dc:title" : { "en-us" : "My second mesh"},
                ...
              }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

The [xmpMM (ISO 16684-1$8.6)](https://github.com/adobe/xmp-docs/blob/master/XMPNamespaces/xmpMM.md) namespaces introduces mechanisms such as Pantry-Ingredient to handle the case when a glTF file is generated via derivation or composition of one or more source documents.
The following example illustrates how `KHR_xmp` metadata can be computed in the case of two glTFs, both containing `asset` metadata, that are processed together to obtain a new composited glTF document.

First glTF document:

```json
{
    "asset": {
        "extensions" : {
            "KHR_xmp": {
                "packet" : 0,
            }
        },
        ...
    },
    "extensions": {
        "KHR_xmp" : {
            "@context" : { "dc" : "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" },
            "packets" : [
              {
                "dc:title" : { "en-us" : "My first glTF"},
                ...
              }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Second glTF document:

```json
{
    "asset": {
        "extensions" : {
            "KHR_xmp": {
                "packet" : 0,
            }
        },
        ...
    },
    "extensions": {
        "KHR_xmp" : {
            "@context" : { "dc" : "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" },
            "packets" : [
              {
                "dc:title" : { "en-us" : "My second glTF"},
                ...
              }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Derived glTF document metadata:

```json
{
    "asset": {
        "extensions" : {
            "KHR_xmp": {
                "packet" : 0,
            }
        },
        ...
    },

              },

### Implementation notes

*This section is non-normative.*

glTF viewers are free to chose which metadata in the glTF to display.
Our recommendation for viewers that choose to display XMP metadata is to include the metadata in the glTF `asset` object.

XMP is an extensible metadata format by design. In order to achieve better readability and interoperability across the industry, we recommend glTF creators to use the following preferred list of namespace prefixes and URIs.

| Namespace prefix  | Namespace URI                         |
|:----------------- |:------------------------------------- |
| `dc`              | `http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/`    |
| `xmp`             | `http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/`        |
| `xmpMM`           | `http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/mm/`     |
