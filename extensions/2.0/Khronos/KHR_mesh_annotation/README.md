## Status

**Draft** â€“ This extension is not yet ratified by the Khronos Group and is subject to change.

## Dependencies

Written against the glTF 2.0 specification.
Can be used alongside rendering-related extensions.

## Overview

The `KHR_mesh_annotation` extension enables arbitrary per-mesh metadata annotations. This provides a generalized way for creators and tools to semantically tag portions of geometry for gameplay, rendering, accessibility, customization, or runtime logic.

Examples include:

- Indicating occlusion, hit zones, body regions, or cosmetics
- Tagging subregions with gameplay affordances (e.g., "touchable", "selectable")
- Supporting accessibility metadata (e.g., limb representation for low-vision aid)
- Facilitating layered rendering systems or shadow pass rules

## Motivation

This was thought of as part of the avatar/character extension proposals; as character models often contain complex geometry with overlapping purposes (e.g. hair, clothing, limbs, devices, accessories). Many applications need to reason about specific mesh subsets, or attribute specific information about them (with it beiong on a per-primitive basis; as each primitive can be a different entity entirely).

## Schema

Annotations are attached at the **primitive level** (i.e., a `mesh.primitives[i]`), and stored in the `KHR_mesh_annotation` extension:

```json
{
  "meshes": [
    {
      "primitives": [
        {
          "attributes": { ... },
          "extensions": {
            "KHR_mesh_annotation": {
              "tags": ["eyewear", "selectable"],
              "customData": { }
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Properties

| Property     | Type     | Description                                                          |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tags`       | string[] | List of free-form labels applicable to this primitive                |
| `customData` | object   | Optional free-form object for runtime-specific annotations (optional) |

## Use Cases & Examples

### 2. Touch Targets

```json
"tags": ["touchable", "interactionZone"]
```

Used by interaction or accessibility systems to identify meaningful geometry.

### 3. Region Metadata for Accessibility

```json
"tags": ["accept button", "UI"]
```

This can drive voiceover descriptions, haptics, or visual aids for users with assistive needs.

### 4. Selectable Cosmetic Submeshes

```json
"tags": ["eyewear", "customizable"]
```

Allows filtering of optional accessories or togglable cosmetic parts.

## Implementation Notes

- Annotations apply at the granularity of `mesh.primitive`, enabling fine control.
- Tags are non-authoritative but enable semantic interoperability across runtimes.
- `tags` allows developers to store free-form labels that can be used to identify, enhance, or provide additional context to the primitive (that may or may not be app-specific). If this metadata is not understood by a client, it should be safely ignored with no visual or functional change.
- `customData` allows developers to store app-specific structured metadata (e.g., color categories, tracking weights, heatmaps). If this metadata is not understood by a client, it should be safely ignored with no visual or functional change.
- If this extension is not understood by a client, it should be safely ignored with no visual or functional change.
