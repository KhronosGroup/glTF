= Overview

This extension adds support for https://www.iso.org/standard/75163.html[XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform) (ISO 16684-1)] metadata to glTF.
Metadata is used to transmit information (such as attribution, licensing, creation date) about the glTF asset. Metadata has no normative effect on the glTF asset appearance and rendering.
XMP is a technology for embedding metadata into documents and has been https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/news/magazine/ISO%20Focus+%20(2010-2013)/en/2012/ISO%20Focus+,%20May%202012.pdf[an ISO standard since 2012].
An instance of the XMP data model is called an XMP packet (ISO 16684-1$6.1).
XMP metadata is embedded in a top-level glTF extension as an array of metadata packets.
XMP metadata packets can then be referenced from glTF objects of type: `asset`, `scene`, `node`, `mesh`, `material`, `image`, `animation`.
XMP metadata referenced by the glTF top-level object `asset` applies to the entire glTF asset.
XMP metadata is organized in namespaces (ISO 16684-1$6.2). This extension enables any XMP metadata namespace to be embedded in a glTF asset.
XMP metadata packets in glTF use a restricted subset of features from JSON-LD. This allows both JSON parsers and JSON-LD parsers to read the individual packets.
Serializing XMP metadata using JSON-LD is outlined in https://www.iso.org/standard/79384.html[JSON-LD serialization of XMP (ISO 16684-3)]. The https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/[JSON-LD specification] outlines the detailed use of JSON-LD 1.1. There are additional restrictions for glTF outlined in <<restrictions-and-recommendations, Restrictions and Recommendations>>.

= XMP data types

This section describes how https://github.com/adobe/xmp-docs/tree/master/XMPNamespaces/XMPDataTypes[XMP data types (ISO 16684-1$6.3)] shall be encoded in glTF.
XMP supports three classes of data types: simple, structure and array. XMP structures are encoded via JSON objects. XMP arrays are encoded via JSON arrays.
XMP simple values are generally encoded via JSON strings with the exception of `Boolean`, `Integer` and `Real` that are encoded as described below.

== XMP Core Properties

:XMPprefix: https://github.com/adobe/xmp-docs/blob/master/XMPNamespaces/XMPDataTypes/CoreProperties.md

The following table describes how {XMPprefix}[XMP Core Properties (ISO 16684-1$8.2)] are encoded in the glTF manifest.

= Defining XMP Metadata

An indirection level is introduced to avoid replicating the same XMP metadata in multiple glTF objects.
XMP metadata are defined within a dictionary property in the glTF file by adding an `extensions` property to the top-level glTF root object and defining a `KHR_xmp_json_ld` object. The `KHR_xmp_json_ld` object defines one property:

  * `packets`: an array of metadata packets. Each packet is JSON-LD compliant (with <<restrictions-and-recommendations, additional restrictions>>, and requires a `@context` dictionary to be defined which includes references for the namespaces.

The following example defines a glTF scene with a sample XMP metadata.

= Instantiating XMP metadata

Metadata can be instantiated in a gltf object by defining the `extensions.KHR_xmp_json_ld` property and, within that, an index into the `packets` array using the `packet` property.
The following example shows a glTF Mesh instantiating the XMP metadata at index `0`.

[source,json]
----
{
  "meshes": [
    {
      "extensions": {
        "KHR_xmp_json_ld": {
          "packet": 0
        }
      },
      "primitives": [
        {
          "attributes": {
            "NORMAL": 23,
            "POSITION": 22,
            "TANGENT": 24,
            "TEXCOORD_0": 25
          },
          "indices": 21,
          "material": 3,
          "mode": 4
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

== Notes:

=== Precedence

Metadata applied to JSON objects in the top level arrays ( `scenes`, `nodes`, `meshes`, `materials`, `images`, `animations`) has precedence over the metadata specified in the `asset` property of a glTF.
A glTF might reference resources already containing XMP metadata. A relevant example would be an image object referencing a PNG or JPEG file with embedded XMP metadata. Note that glTF clients and viewers may ignore the metadata embedded in the referenced resources (for instance PNG or JPEG images).

[[restrictions-and-recommendations]]
=== Restrictions and Recommendations

In order to keep glTF files easily readable with either a JSON or https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/[JSON-LD] parser and keep compatibility with https://www.iso.org/standard/79384.html[ISO 16684-3], there are additional restrictions that are required for `KHR_xmp_json_ld` metadata packets. Failure to obey these restrictions may create issues for parsers.

  * https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#expanded-term-definition[Expanded term definitions] are forbidden.
  * Compact IRIs (_prefix:suffix_) are required by https://www.iso.org/standard/79384.html[ISO 16684-3]. Due to this, `@base` and `@vocab` keywords are always ignored.
  * Namespace prefixes are recommended to use the latin alphabet `A` to `Z` uppercase or lowercase, roman numerals `0` to `9`, or `_`.
  * Aliases and multiple prefixes for the same namespace are forbidden.
  * https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#value-objects[Value objects] are forbidden unless otherwise specified, such as with Language Alternatives or when providing a content language for Text types.
  * XMP fields containing arrays must use the `@list` and `@set` keywords as a parent to the array, to indicate if the array is ordered or unordered. See the <<lists-and-sets, Lists and Sets>> section for details.
  * Local contexts are forbidden, except when providing a content language for Text types.
  * Language alternatives must use an `rdf:Alt` type. See the <<language-alternatives, Language Alternatives>> section for details.
  * Non-string data types such as `Boolean`, `Integer`, and `Real` must use JSON types.

These restrictions ensure that `KHR_xmp_json_ld` metadata remains readable regardless if the parser supports JSON-LD.

Additionally, the following are recommended:

  * XMP data types are always preferred. Only use a non XMP data type if there is no other option.
  * For proper compatibility with https://www.iso.org/standard/79384.html[ISO 16684-3], an AboutURI should be included at the root level of each packet in an `@id`. For most purposes the value can be left blank.

[[lists-and-sets]]
=== Lists and Sets

The XMP specification makes a distinction between ordered lists and unordered sets, but in the case of JSON all arrays are considered to be ordered lists. (See https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7159.txt[RFC-7159].) In order to handle the differences between ordered lists and unordered sets, all arrays within a `packet` must be children of a `@list` or `@set` property to differentiate between ordered lists and unordered sets respectively. Descriptions for the two fields and examples are provided below.

  * `@list` denotes that the child array is an ordered list.
  * `@set` denotes that the child array is an unordered set.

Choosing when to use an ordered list or an unordered set is typically decided by the schema in use. For example, the Dublin Core (`dc` prefix) schema states that `dc:creator` uses an ordered list, and `dc:contributor` uses an unordered set.

An example packet using `@list` for an ordered list of creators:

[source,json]
----
{
  "asset": {
    "extensions": {
      "KHR_xmp_json_ld": {
        "packet": 0
      }
    },
    ...
  },
  "extensions": {
    "KHR_xmp_json_ld": {
      "packets": [
        {
          "@context": {
            "dc": "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
          },
          "@id": "",
          "dc:creator": {
            "@list": ["CreatorName", "CreatorEmail@email.com"]
          },
          ...
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

An example packet using `@set` for an unordered list of contributors:

[source,json]
----
{
  "asset": {
    "extensions": {
      "KHR_xmp_json_ld": {
        "packet": 0
      }
    },
    ...
  },
  "extensions": {
    "KHR_xmp_json_ld": {
      "packets": [
        {
          "@context": {
            "dc": "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
          },
          "@id": "",
          "dc:contributor": {
            "@set": [
              "Creator1Name",
              "Creator2Email@email.com",
              "Creator3Name<Email@email.com>"
            ]
          }
          ...
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

[[language-alternatives]]
=== Language Alternatives

Language Alternatives provide a powerful way of handling internationalization within XMP metadata. In order to remain compliant with the requirements outlined in the https://www.iso.org/standard/79384.html[JSON-LD serialization of XMP (ISO 16684-3)] specification `KHR_xmp_json_ld` relies on usage of the `@language` and `@value` keywords contained in an object of the `rdf:Alt` type. A field containing language alternatives must contain a `@type` definition for `rdf:Alt`, and each alternative must be contained in a `rdf:_N` property, where `N` is the index. The `rdf` namespace (`http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#`) must also be included in the packet's `@context`. The `rdf:_N` property must have an object containing two properties:

  * `@language` with a IETF BCP 47 language code as the value.
  * `@value` with actual value of the XMP property as a string.

An example glTF with only one language:

[source,json]

              "@value": "My Model"
            }

          ...
        }

    }

              "@value": "My Model"
            },
            "rdf:_2": {
              "@language": "it-it",
              "@value": "Mio Modello"
            }
          },
          ...
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

=== Transferring and merging metadata

When a glTF object (for example a Mesh) is copied from a glTF file to another, the associated `KHR_xmp_json_ld` metadata should be copied as well.
Copying metadata requires adding the source object's metadata packets to the destination glTF's `KHR_xmp_json_ld.packets` array.
In the following example two glTFs containing a mesh with `KHR_xmp_json_ld` metadata are copied into a third glTF.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
When merging metadata between two glTF objects, namespaces should be normalized based on the namespace URI. Example: Object A uses `dc` for the Dublin Core, but Object B uses `dc11` for the Dublin Core, so the implementer must normalize these based on the namespace URI and pick either `dc` or `dc11` as the prefix for the unified packet.

The https://github.com/adobe/xmp-docs/blob/master/XMPNamespaces/xmpMM.md[xmpMM (ISO 16684-1$8.6)] namespaces introduces mechanisms such as Pantry-Ingredient to handle the case when a glTF file is generated via derivation or composition of one or more source documents.
The following example illustrates how `KHR_xmp_json_ld` metadata can be computed in the case of two glTFs, both containing `asset` metadata, that are processed together to obtain a new composited glTF document.

First glTF document:

[source,json]
----
{
  "asset": {
    "extensions": {
      "KHR_xmp_json_ld": {
        "packet": 0
      }
    },
    ...
  },
  "extensions": {
    "KHR_xmp_json_ld": {
      "packets": [
        {
          "@context": {
            "dc": "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/",
            "rdf": "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
          },
          "@id": "",
          "dc:title": {
            "@type": "rdf:Alt",
            "rdf:_1": {
              "@language": "en-us",
              "@value": "My first glTF"
            }
          },
          ...
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

Second glTF document:

[source,json]
----
{
  "asset": {
    "extensions": {
      "KHR_xmp_json_ld": {
        "packet": 0
      }
    },
    ...
  },
  "extensions": {
    "KHR_xmp_json_ld": {
      "packets": [
        {
          "@context": {
            "dc": "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/",
            "rdf": "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
          },
          "@id": "",
          "dc:title": {
            "@type": "rdf:Alt",
            "rdf:_1": {
              "@language": "en-us",
              "@value": "My second glTF"
            }
          },
          ...
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

== Implementation Notes

_This section is non-normative._

glTF viewers are free to chose which metadata in the glTF to display.
Our recommendation for viewers that choose to display XMP metadata is to include the metadata in the glTF `asset` object.

XMP is an extensible metadata format by design. In order to achieve better readability and interoperability across the industry, we recommend glTF creators to use the following preferred list of namespace prefixes and URIs.

[options="header"]
|====
| Preferred prefix | Namespace URI                                      | Usage
| `dc`             | `http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/`                 | Dublin Core
| `xmp`            | `http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/`                     | Basic Descriptive Information
| `xmpGImg`        | `http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/g/img/`               | `xmp:Thumbnails`
| `xmpMM`          | `http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/mm/`                  | Media Management, used by Digital Asset Management systems
| `stRef`          | `http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/sType/ResourceRef#`   | `xmpMM:DerivedFrom`, `xmpMM:Ingredients`, `xmpMM:ManagedForm`
| `stEvt`          | `http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/sType/ResourceEvent#` | `xmpMM:History`
| `stVer`          | `http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/sType/Version#`       | `xmpMM:Versions`
| `xmpRights`      | `http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/rights/`              | Legal restrictions associated with a resource
| `rdf`            | `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#`      | Resource Description Framework; Primarily used for Language Alternatives in XMP JSON-LD
