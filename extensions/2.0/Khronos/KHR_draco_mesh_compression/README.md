## Status

Complete

## Dependencies

Written against the glTF 2.0 spec.

## Overview

This extension defines a schema to use [Draco geometry compression (non-normative)](https://github.com/google/draco) libraries in glTF format. This allows glTF to support streaming compressed geometry data instead of the raw data. This extension specification is based on [Draco bitstream version 2.2 (the entirety of this specification is normative and included in Scope)](https://google.github.io/draco/spec/).

The [conformance](#conformance) section specifies what an implementation must do when encountering this extension, and how the extension interacts with the attributes defined in the base specification.

## glTF Schema Updates

If a `primitive` contains an `extension` property and the `extension` property defines its `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` property, then the Draco geometry compression must be used.

The following picture shows the structure of the schema update.

**Figure 1**: Structure of geometry compression extension.
![](figures/structure.png)

The Draco extension points to the `bufferView` that contains the compressed data.
If the uncompressed version of the asset is not provided, then `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` must be added to `extensionsRequired`.
```javascript
"extensionsRequired" : [
    "KHR_draco_mesh_compression"
]

```
If the `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` property is set in `extensionsRequired` then the primitive must only contain the Draco compressed data.
If a Draco compressed version of the asset is provided then `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` must be added to `extensionsUsed`.

Usage of the extension must be listed in the `extensionsUsed`.

```javascript
"extensionsUsed" : [
    "KHR_draco_mesh_compression"
]

```

Below is an example of what part of a glTF file will look like if the Draco extension is set. Note that all other nodes stay the same except `primitives`:

```javascript

"mesh" : {
    "primitives" : [
        {
            "attributes" : {
                "POSITION" : 11,
                "NORMAL" : 12,
                "TEXCOORD_0" : 13,
                "WEIGHTS_0" : 14,
                "JOINTS_0" : 15
            },
            "indices" : 10,
            "mode" : 4,
            "extensions" : {
                "KHR_draco_mesh_compression" : {
                    "bufferView" : 5,
                    "attributes" : {
                        "POSITION" : 0,
                        "NORMAL" : 1,
                        "TEXCOORD_0" : 2,
                        "WEIGHTS_0" : 3,
                        "JOINTS_0" : 4
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

"bufferViews" : [
    // ...
    // bufferView of Id 5
    {
        "buffer" : 10,
        "byteOffset" : 1024,
        "byteLength" : 10000
    }
    // ...
}

```
#### bufferView
The `bufferView` property points to the buffer containing compressed data. The data must be passed to a mesh decoder and decompressed to a mesh.

### attributes
`attributes` defines the attributes stored in the decompressed geometry. e.g., in the example above, `POSITION`, `NORMAL`, `TEXCOORD_0`, `WEIGHTS_0` and `JOINTS_0`. Each attribute is associated with an attribute id which is its unique id in the compressed data. The `attributes` defined in the extension must be a subset of the attributes of the primitive. To request an attribute, loaders must be able to use the correspondent attribute id specified in the `attributes` to get the attribute from the compressed data.

### accessors
The `accessors` properties corresponding to the `attributes` and `indices` of the `primitives` must match the decompressed data.

#### Restrictions on geometry type
When using this extension, the `mode` of `primitive` must be either `TRIANGLES` or `TRIANGLE_STRIP` and the mesh data will be decoded accordingly.

### JSON Schema

For full details on the `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` extension properties, see the schema:

* [extension property (the entirety of this specification is normative and included in Scope)](schema/mesh.primitive.KHR_draco_mesh_compression.schema.json)

## Conformance

Below is the recommended process when a loader encounters a glTF asset with the Draco extension set:

* If `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` is in `extensionsRequired` and the loader does not support the Draco extension, then the loader must fail loading the asset.
* If the loader does not support the Draco extension and `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` is not in `extensionsRequired`, then load the glTF asset ignoring `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` in `primitive`.
* If the loader does support the Draco extension, but will not process `KHR_draco_mesh_compression`, then the loader must load the glTF asset ignoring `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` in `primitive`.
* If the loader does support the Draco extension, and will process `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` then:
    * The loader must process `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` first. The loader must get the data from `KHR_draco_mesh_compression`'s `bufferView` property and decompress the data using a Draco decoder to a Draco geometry.
    * Then the loader must process `attributes` and `indices` properties of the `primitive`. When loading each `accessor`, you must ignore the `bufferView` and `byteOffset` of the `accessor` and go to the previously decoded Draco geometry in the `primitive` to get the data of indices and attributes. A loader must use the decompressed data to fill the `accessors` or render the decompressed Draco geometry directly (e.g. [ThreeJS (non-normative)](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/js/loaders/DRACOLoader.js)).
    * If additional attributes are defined in `primitive`'s `attributes`, but not defined in `KHR_draco_mesh_compression`'s `attributes`, then the loader must process the additional attributes as usual.

## Implementation note

*This section is non-normative.*

To prevent transmission of redundant data, exporters should generally write compressed Draco data into a separate buffer from the uncompressed fallback, and shared data into a third buffer. Loaders may then optimize to request only the necessary buffers.

Draco compression may change the order and number of vertices in a mesh. To satisfy the requirement that `accessors` properties be correct for both compressed and uncompressed data, generators should create uncompressed `attributes` and `indices` using data that has been decompressed from the Draco buffer, rather than the original source data.
