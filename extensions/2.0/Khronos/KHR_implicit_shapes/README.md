## Status

Release Candidate

## Dependencies

Written against glTF 2.0 spec.

## Overview

This extension adds data definitions for implicit shapes. This extension does not mandate any particular behaviour for these objects aside from a description of their geometry. These types are to be used in combination with other extensions which should specify the behavior of these types.

## glTF Schema Updates

### Shapes

This extension provides a set of document-level objects, which can be referenced by objects in a glTF document.

Shapes are defined within a dictionary property in the glTF scene description file, by adding an `extensions` property to the top-level glTF 2.0 object and defining a `KHR_implicit_shapes` property with a `shapes` array inside it.

Each shape defines a mandatory `type` property which designates the type of shape, as well as an additional structure which provides parameterizations specific to that type. The following example defines a sphere.

```javascript
"extensions": {
    "KHR_implicit_shapes" : {
        "shapes": [
            {
                "sphere": { "radius": 0.1 },
                "type": "sphere"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

To describe the geometry which represents the object, shapes must define at most one of the following properties:

| |Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|**sphere**|`object`|A sphere centered at the origin in local space.|
|**box**|`object`|An axis-aligned box centered at the origin in local space.|
|**cylinder**|`object`|A cylinder centered at the origin and aligned along the Y axis in local space, with potentially different radii at each end. A cone is a special case of cylinder when one of the radii is zero.|
|**capsule**|`object`|A capsule (cylinder with hemispherical ends) centered at the origin and defined by two "capping" spheres with potentially different radii, aligned along the Y axis in local space.|

When the `type` of a shape refers to a shape type defined by this extension, the shape must not supply a value for a different shape type e.g. a shape whose `type` is "box" must not have a defined `sphere` property. Similarly, if `type` does not reference a shape type declared by `KHR_implicit_shapes`, an extension or other mechanism should supply an alternate shape definition.

Degenerate shapes are prohibited. A sphere must have a positive, non-zero radius. A box shape must have positive non-zero values for each component of `size`. The cylinder and capsule shapes must have a positive, non-zero `height`, both `radiusTop` and `radiusBottom` must be non-negative, and at least one of `radiusTop` and `radiusBottom` must be non-zero.

### Object Model

With consideration to the glTF 2.0 Asset Object Model Specification document, the following pointer templates represent mutable properties defined in this extension.

| Pointer | Type|
|-|-|
| `/extensions/KHR_implicit_shapes/shapes/{}/box/size` | `float3`|
| `/extensions/KHR_implicit_shapes/shapes/{}/capsule/height` | `float`|
| `/extensions/KHR_implicit_shapes/shapes/{}/capsule/radiusBottom` | `float`|
| `/extensions/KHR_implicit_shapes/shapes/{}/capsule/radiusTop` | `float`|
| `/extensions/KHR_implicit_shapes/shapes/{}/cylinder/height` | `float`|
| `/extensions/KHR_implicit_shapes/shapes/{}/cylinder/radiusBottom` | `float`|
| `/extensions/KHR_implicit_shapes/shapes/{}/cylinder/radiusTop` | `float`|
| `/extensions/KHR_implicit_shapes/shapes/{}/sphere/radius` | `float`|

Additional read-only properties

| Pointer | Type|
|-|-|
| `/extensions/KHR_implicit_shapes/shapes.length` | `int`|
