[[introduction]]
= Introduction

[[introduction-general]]
== General

This document, referred to as the "`glTF Interactivity Extension Specification`" or just the "`Specification`" hereafter, describes the `KHR_interactivity` glTF extension.

This extension aims to enhance glTF 2.0 by adding the ability to encode behavior and interactivity in 3D assets.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
This specification is for single user experiences only and does not deal with any of the complexity involved in multi-user networked experiences.
====

[[introduction-conventions]]
== Document Conventions

The glTF Interactivity Extension Specification is intended for use by both implementers of the asset exporters or converters (e.g., digital content creation tools) and application developers seeking to import or load interactive glTF assets, forming a basis for interoperability between these parties.

Specification text can address either party; typically, the intended audience can be inferred from context, though some sections are defined to address only one of these parties.

Any requirements, prohibitions, recommendations, or options defined by <<introduction-normative-terminology, normative terminology>> are imposed only on the audience of that text.

[[introduction-normative-terminology]]
=== Normative Terminology and References

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**,  **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as described in <<bcp14,BCP 14>>.

These key words are highlighted in the specification for clarity.

References to external documents are considered normative if the Specification uses any of the normative terms defined in this section to refer to them or their requirements, either as a whole or in part.

[[introduction-informative-language]]
=== Informative Language

Some language in the specification is purely informative, intended to give background or suggestions to implementers or developers.

If an entire chapter or section contains only informative language, its title is suffixed with "`(Informative)`". If not designated as informative, all chapters, sections, and appendices in this document are normative.

All Notes, Implementation notes, and Examples are purely informative.

[[motivation]]
== Motivation and Design Goals (Informative)

glTF 2.0 assets are widely used in various industries, including automotive, e-commerce, and gaming. There is a growing demand for adding logic and behavior to glTF assets, particularly in the metaverse. This extension aims to fulfill this demand by providing a portable, easily implementable, safe, and visually accessible solution for adding behavior to glTF assets. The extension is inspired by visual scripting features of leading game engines and aims to deliver a minimum meaningful and extensible feature set.

=== What Is a Behavior Graph?
A behavior graph is a series of interconnected nodes that represent behaviors and interactions in a 3D asset. It can respond to events and cause changes in the asset's appearance and behavior.

=== What Problems Can They Solve?
Behavior graphs offer a flexible and multi-functional approach to encoding behavior, making them useful for various applications. For instance, they can be used to create smart assets with behavior and interactions, AR experiences with user interactions, and immersive game levels with dynamic assets and objectives.

=== What Do They Not Solve?
Behavior graphs are not designed to handle UI presentation or arbitrary scripting. Creating a 3D UI using behavior graphs would be complex, not portable, and not accessible. Similarly, arbitrary scripting is challenging to make safe, portable across platforms, and has a vast surface area.

=== Comparison with Trigger-Action Lists
Behavior graphs and trigger-action lists are the two common models for representing and executing behaviors in the digital world. Common 3D experience commerce tools use trigger-action lists, while behavior graphs are typically used by high-end game engines. In this section, we will explore the differences and similarities between these two models, and explain why glTF chose to adopt behavior graphs.

Behavior graphs and trigger-action lists share common features, such as being safe and sandboxed, offering limited execution models controlled by the viewer, and both supporting the “trigger” and “action” node categories. However, there are also significant differences between the two models. Trigger-action lists lack “Queries”, “Logic”, and “Control Flow” nodes, meaning that sophisticated behavior based on queries, logic, or control flow branches is not possible. This lack of functionality greatly affects the ability to create complex behavior and control structures and rules out the implementation of advanced control flow structures in the future.

On the other hand, behavior graphs are a superset of trigger-action lists, meaning that the former can support everything that trigger-action lists can, and more. Behavior graphs support “Queries”, “Logic” and “Control Flow” nodes, making them more expressive and capable of creating more sophisticated behaviors. This makes behavior graphs the preferred method of choice for high-end game engines, as it offers an identical safety model as trigger-action lists while being more expressive.

=== Turing Completeness
The execution model and node choices for this extension mean that it is Turing-complete. This means that an implementation of this can execute any computation and it is also hard to predict if it will run forever (e.g. halt or not.)

While this may present security implications, it is not a major hindrance and can be safely mitigated so that any implementation does not become susceptible to denial of services by badly behaving behavior graphs, whether intention or not.

The main way to mitigate the risk of non-halting behavior graphs is to limit the amount of time given to them for execution, both in terms of individual time slice as well as overall execution time.

=== Implementation Limitations
There will be limitations in engines and devices to such as:

* Number of nodes in the graph
* Number of variables
* Number of custom events
* Number of concurrent pending events/async nodes
* Number of nodes executed per time slice
* Speed of graph execution

These limitations are not defined in this specification.


[[concepts]]
= Concepts

[[concepts-general]]
== Graphs

A behavior graph is a JSON object containing _nodes_. It **MAY** also contain custom variables and custom events.

Behavior graphs are directed graphs with no directed cycles.

[[nodes]]
== Nodes and Sockets

A _node_ is a JSON object, which represents an executable item. Each node is defined by its _type_ and a set of _sockets_. There are four kinds of sockets.

_Output value sockets_ represent data initialized by the node or produced during its execution. For example, it could be results of math operations or parts of the node's internal state. Accessing these sockets either triggers computing the return value on the fly by executing the node or returns a value based on the node's internal state. Exact behavior depends on the node's type.

_Input value sockets_ represent data accessed during the node's execution. For example, it could be arguments of math operations or execution parameters such as iteration count for loop nodes or duration for time-related nodes. These sockets **MUST** either be given a static value in the node object or connected to an output value socket of a different node. The node **MAY** access its input value sockets multiple times during the execution. The runtime **MUST** guarantee that all input value sockets have defined values when the node execution starts.

_Output flow sockets_ represent "`function pointers`" that the node will call to advance the graph execution. For example, bodies and branches of flow control nodes are output flow sockets that drive further execution when certain condition are fulfilled. Output flow sockets **MAY** be unconnected; in such a case graph execution proceeds as if such sockets are no-ops.

_Input flow sockets_ represent "`methods`" that could be called on the node. For example, flow control nodes (such as loops and conditions) usually have an `in` input flow socket that starts node's execution. Additional operations **MAY** also be defined such as `reset` for nodes having an internal state.

Nodes **MAY** be configurable through static properties collectively called "`node's configuration`" that **MAY** affect the node's behavior and the number of its sockets, such as the number of cases for a switch-case control flow node.

Input and output value sockets have associated data types, e.g., floats, integers, booleans, etc.

Node's sockets and configurations are defined by its _type_. Node types follow `domain/operation` naming pattern.

A node is executed when its input flow socket is reached by or when one of its output value sockets is requested by another node. Usually, the node executes its dependencies (if any), its own logic, and any number (including zero) of outgoing flow sockets.

.2+| Output value sockets
| `T value`  | The resolved property value
| `bool isValid`  | True if the property value can be resolved, false otherwise
|===

This node gets a glTF Asset Object Model value using the provided JSON pointer. The type `T` is determined by the pointer string according to the glTF Asset Object Model Specification. If the type of the pointer cannot be statically determined, the node is invalid. Pointers containing `extras` properties are out of scope of this specification but **MAY** be supported by implementations.

[NOTE]
.Examples
====
The `pointer` configuration value `"/nodes/0/scale"` is valid; its output value socket is of `float3` type.

The `pointer` configuration value `"/myProperty"` is invalid because this path is not defined.
====

The pointer string **MAY** be a template pointer string, i.e., it **MAY** contain path segments substituted at runtime using the input values. All input values **MUST** be of `int` type. Path segments, if used, **MUST** substitute only array indices in the pointer templates as listed in the glTF Asset Object Model Specification.

[NOTE]
.Example
====
If the `pointer` configuration value is `"/nodes/{myId}/scale"`, the node has the `myId` input value socket, which value denotes the node index.
====

This node has no internal state.

If the pointer or the pointer template with all its substitutions applied can be resolved, the `value` output value is the resolved property value and the `isValid` output value is true.

If the pointer or the pointer template with all its substitutions applied cannot be resolved, the `value` output value is the default value for its type and the `isValid` output value is false.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Unresolvable pointers include those with negative or out-of-bounds array indices and/or non-existent JSON objects.
