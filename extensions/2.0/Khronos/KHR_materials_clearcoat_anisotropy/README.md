## Status

Draft

## Dependencies

Written against the glTF 2.0 spec.

## Exclusions

- This extension must not be used on a material that also uses `KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness`.
- This extension must not be used on a material that also uses `KHR_materials_unlit`.
- This extension should be used as a sub-extension of `KHR_materials_clearcoat`.

## Overview

This extension defines anisotropic properties for the clearcoat layer of a material. It allows the clearcoat layer to exhibit anisotropic behavior, where the specular reflection is stretched in one direction, similar to brushed metal or directionally polished surfaces. This extension modifies the microfacet distribution of the clearcoat layer in exactly the same way that the base layer [KHR_materials_anisotropy](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_anisotropy/README.md) does.

## Extending Materials

Anisotropy can be added to the clearcoat layer by adding the `KHR_materials_clearcoat_anisotropy` sub-extension to any compatible glTF material that also uses `KHR_materials_clearcoat`. For example, the following defines a material with anisotropic clearcoat:

```json
{
    "materials": [
        {
            "name": "brushed_metal_coated",
            "extensions": {
                "KHR_materials_clearcoat": {
                    "clearcoatFactor": 1.0,
                    "clearcoatRoughnessFactor": 0.1,
                    "extensions": {
                    "KHR_materials_clearcoat_anisotropy": {
                        "clearcoatAnisotropyStrength": 0.8,
                        "clearcoatAnisotropyRotation": 1.57
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Clearcoat Anisotropy Parameters

The following parameters are contributed by the `KHR_materials_clearcoat_anisotropy` extension:

|                                    | Type                                                                            | Description                                  | Required             |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
|**clearcoatAnisotropyStrength**     | `number`                                                                        | The clearcoat anisotropy strength. When the anisotropy texture is present, this value is multiplied by the texture's blue channel.      | No, default: `0.0`   |
|**clearcoatAnisotropyRotation**     | `number`                                                                        | The clearcoat anisotropy rotation in tangent, bitangent space, measured in radians counter-clockwise from the tangent. When the anisotropy texture is present, this value provides additional rotation to the vectors in the texture.          | No, default: `0.0`   |
|**clearcoatAnisotropyTexture**      | [`textureInfo`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#reference-textureinfo)             | The clearcoat anisotropy texture. Red and green channels represent the anisotropy direction in [âˆ’1,1] tangent, bitangent space to be rotated by the anisotropy rotation. The blue channel contains strength as [0,1] to be multiplied by the anisotropy strength.          | No                   |

If `clearcoatAnisotropyStrength` is zero, no anisotropic behavior is applied to the clearcoat layer.

The values for clearcoat anisotropy strength and rotation can be defined using factors, textures, or both. If the `clearcoatAnisotropyTexture` is not given, respective texture components are assumed to have default values. All clearcoat anisotropy textures contain RGB components in linear space. If both factors and textures are present, the factor value acts as a linear multiplier for the corresponding texture values.

## Anisotropy

This extension modifies the microfacet distribution of the clearcoat layer in exactly the same way that the base layer [KHR_materials_anisotropy](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_anisotropy/README.md) does. Please reference that specification for details.
