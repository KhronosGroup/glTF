## Status

Complete

## Dependencies

Written against the glTF 2.0 spec.

## Exclusions

* This extension must not be used on a material that also uses `KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness`.
* This extension must not be used on a material that also uses `KHR_materials_unlit`.

## Overview

The dielectric BRDF of the metallic-roughness material in glTF uses a fixed value of 1.5 for the index of refraction. This is a good fit for many plastics and glass, but not for other materials like water or asphalt, sapphire or diamond. This extensions allows users to set the index of refraction to a certain value.

## Extending Materials

The index of refraction of a material is configured by adding the `KHR_materials_ior` extension to any glTF material. 

```json
{
    "materials": [
        {
            "extensions": {
                "KHR_materials_ior": {
                    "ior": 1.4,
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

| |Type|Description|Required|
|-|----|-----------|--------|
| **ior** | `number` | The index of refraction. | No, default: `1.5`|

Typical values for the index of refraction range from 1 to 2. In rare cases values greater than 2 are possible. The following table shows some materials and their index of refraction:

| Material     | Index of Refraction |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Air          | 1.0                 |
| Water        | 1.33                |
| Eyes         | 1.38                |
| Window Glass | 1.52                |
| Sapphire     | 1.76                |
| Diamond      | 2.42                |

The ior parameter affects the `dielectric_brdf` of the glTF 2.0 metallic-roughness material. The new `dielectric_brdf` that includes the `ior` parameter is given as follows:

```
dielectric_brdf =
  fresnel_mix(
    ior = ior,
    base = diffuse_brdf(
      color = baseColor),
    layer = specular_brdf(
      Î± = roughness^2))
```

Valid values for `ior` are numbers greater than or equal to 1. In addition, a value of 0 is allowed. This value gives full weight to `layer`, i.e., the Fresnel term evaluates to 1 independent of the view or light direction. It is useful in combination with `KHR_materials_specular` to seamlessly support the specular-glossiness workflow.

## Implementation

*This section is non-normative*

The extension changes the computation of the Fresnel term defined in [Appendix B](/specification/2.0/README.md#appendix-b-brdf-implementation) to the following:

```
const dielectricSpecular = ((ior - 1)/(ior + 1))^2
```

Note that for the default index of refraction `ior = 1.5` this term evaluates to `dielectricSpecular = 0.04`.

## Interaction with other extensions

If `KHR_materials_specular` is used in combination with `KHR_materials_ior`, the Fresnel term is additionally scaled by the values given `specular` and `specularColor`. See [`KHR_materials_specular`](../KHR_materials_specular/README.md) for more information.

If `KHR_materials_transmission` is used in combination with `KHR_materials_ior`, the `ior` affects the strength of the transmission effect according to the Fresnel term. See [`KHR_materials_transmission`](../KHR_materials_transmission/README.md) for more information. If `KHR_materials_specular` is used in addition, the Fresnel term is additionally scaled by the values given in `specular` and `specularColor`.

If `KHR_materials_volume` is used in combination with `KHR_materials_ior`, the `ior` affects the refraction effect. See [`KHR_materials_volume`](../KHR_materials_volume/README.md) for more information.
