## Overview

This extension defines a set of common materials and lights for use with glTF. 

glTF does not define a lighting model, instead relegating shading of visuals to GLSL shader code defined within techniques in the glTF file. For many use cases, it is desirable to shade visuals with commonly understood and implemented shading techniques, such as Blinn and Lambert.

Many 3D tools and WebGL runtimes support built-in implementations of common material and light types. Using this extension, tools can export a much more compact representation of materials and lights. In addition, a runtimes with built-in lighting can apply its built-in light values to visuals shaded with common materials found in the glTF file. 

This extension defines four light types: `directional`, `point`, `spot`, and `ambient`; and the material types `blinn`, `phong`, `lambert` and `constant`, for Blinn-Phong, Phong, Lambert and Unlit ("constant" color) materials, respectively.

The [conformance](#conformance) section specifies what an implementation must to do when encountering this extension, and how the extension interacts with the materials defined in the base specification.

## Materials

### Extending Materials

Common materials are defined by adding an `extensions` property to any glTF material, and defining its `KHR_materials_common` property. For example, the following defines a material with a Lambert shader with 50% gray diffuse color:

```javascript
    "materials": {
            "lambert1": {
                "extensions": {
                    "KHR_materials_common" : {
                        // one of CONSTANT,
                        // BLINN,
                        // PHONG,
                        // LAMBERT
                        "technique" : "LAMBERT",
                        "values": {
                            "diffuse": [0.5,0.5,0.5,1]
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        },
```

### Material Types

#### Common Material Shared Properties

Table 1 lists properties that are shared among several of the common material types.

#### Blinn-Phong

Blinn-Phong approximation. Uses all of the common material properties defined in Table 1. The following example defines a Blinn-Phong lit material with a diffuse texture, moderate shininess and red specular highlights. 

```javascript
    "materials": {
        "blinn1": {
            "extensions": {
                "KHR_materials_common" : {
					   "technique" : "BLINN",
						"values": {
						    "diffuse": "texture_1",
						    "shininess": 10,
						    "specular": [
						        1,
						        0,
						        0,
						        1
						    ]
						}
					}
            }
        }
        },
```

#### Phong

Phong lighting. Uses all of the common material properties defined in Table 1. The following example defines a Phong lit material with a white diffuse color, environment map texture and high reflectivity.

```javascript
    "materials": {
        "blinn1": {
            "extensions": {
                "KHR_materials_common" : {
					   "technique" : "PHONG",
						"values": {
						    "diffuse": [
						    	1,
						    	1,
						    	1,
						    	1
						    ],
						    "relective": "texture_envmap",
						    "refectivity": 1
						}
					}
            }
        }
        },
```

#### Lambert

Lambert shading does not reflect specular highlights; therefore the common material properties `specular` and `shininess` are not used. All other properties from Table 1 apply.

The following example defines a Lambert lit material with a 50% gray emissive color and a diffuse texture map.

```javascript
    "materials": {
        "blinn1": {
            "extensions": {
                "KHR_materials_common" : {
					   "technique" : "LAMBERT",
						"values": {
							"diffuse": "texture_1",
						    "emission": [
						    	0.5,
						    	0.5,
						    	0.5,
						    	1
						    ],
						}
					}
            }
        }
        },
```

#### Constant

Constant shading does not reflect light sources in the scene; therefore the common material properties `ambient`, `diffuse`, `specular` and `shininess` are not used. All other properties from Table 1 apply.

The following example defines a Constant lit material with a 50% gray emissive color and 50% opacity.

```javascript
    "materials": {
        "blinn1": {
            "extensions": {
                "KHR_materials_common" : {
					   "technique" : "CONSTANT",
						"values": {
							"emissive": [
								0.5,
								0.5,
								0.5,
								1
							],
							"transparency": 0.5
						}
					}
            }
        }
        },
```

## Lights

Lights define light sources in the scene.

Lights are contained in nodes and thus can be transformed. Their world-space positions can be used in shader calculations.

### Defining Lights

Lights are defined within a dictionary property in the file, by adding an `extensions` property to the top-level glTF object and defining its `KHR_materials_common` property with a `lights` dictionary object inside it. 

Each light defines a `type` property that designates the type of light (`ambient`, `directional`, `point` or `spot`); a property of that same name defines the details, such as color, attenuation and other light type-specific values. The following example defines a white-colored directional light.


```javascript
    "extensions": {

        "KHR_materials_common" : {

            "lights": {
                "light1": {
                    "directional": {
                        "color": [
                            1,
                            1,
                            1
                        ]
                    },
                    "type": "directional"
                }
            },

        }
    },
```

IDs of any property within the `lights` extension property are treated like other glTF IDs, i.e. they are added to the global ID space.


### Adding Light Instances to Nodes

Lights are glTF scene objects: they have position and orientation, which can be animated. Lights are placed in the scene by defining an `extensions` property of a node, and within that a `KHR_materials_common` property that identifies a light using its `light` property.

```javascript
    "nodes": {
        "node1" : {
            "children" : [
            ],
            "extensions": {
                "KHR_materials_common" : {
                    "light" : "light1",
                }
            }            
        }
    }
```

### Light Types

#### Common Light Shared Properties

Table 2 lists properties that are shared among several of the common light types.

Table 2. Common Light Shared Properties

| Property                     | Type         | Description | Default Value | Applies To |
|:----------------------------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
| `color`                      | `FLOAT_VEC4` | RGBA value for light's color.|[0,0,0,1] | `ambient`, `directional`, `point`, `spot` |
| `constant_attenuation`       | `FLOAT` | Constant attenuation of point and spot lights. | 0 | `point`, `spot` |
| `direction`                   | `FLOAT_VEC4` | Vector defining direction of directional and spot lights. | [0,0,-1] | `directional`, `spot` |
| `distance`                   | `FLOAT` | Distance, in world units, over which the light affects objects in the scene. A value of zero indicates infinite distance. | 0 | `point`, `spot` |
| `linear_attenuation`       | `FLOAT` | Linear (distance-based) attenuation of point and spot lights. | 1 | `point`, `spot` |
| `type`                    | string | Declares the type of the light. Must be one of `ambient`, `directional`, `point` or `spot` | "" | `ambient`, `directional`, `point`, `spot` |

### Ambient

Ambient lights define constant lighting throughout the scene, as reflected in the `ambient` property of any material. Ambient lights support only the `color` common light property described in Table 2.

#### Directional

Directional lights are light sources that emit from infinitely far away in a specified direction. This light type uses the common light properties `color` and `direction` described in Table 2.

### Point

Point lights emit light in all directions over a given distance. Point lights support the `color`, `constant_attenuation`, `distance` and `linear_attenuation` common light properties described in Table 2. Point lights do not have a direction.


### Spot

Sport lights emit light in a directions over a given distance. Spot lights support the `color`, `constant_attenuation`, `direction`, `distance` and `linear_attenuation` common light properties described in Table 2. Spot lights also define the following properties:

Table 3. Spot Light Properties

| Property                     | Type         | Description | Default Value |
|:----------------------------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| `falloff_angle`              | `FLOAT` | Falloff angle for the spot light, in radians.| PI / 2 |
| `falloff_exponent`           | `FLOAT` | Falloff exponent for the spotlight. *[need to define range and semantics]* | 0 |

<a name="conformance"></a>
## Conformance

If this extension is supported, it will be used to apply shading to any visuals defined with common material types. 

If a material contains this extension as well as a technique instance, the runtime can use its own shader implementation in favor of the supplied technique. 

If the extension is not supported, and no technique is supplied in the material, then default shading will be applied per the rules defined in the base specification.
